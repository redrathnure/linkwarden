# Fork Info

A staging repository for Linkwarden improvements. A following changes were done here:

1. Docker image is run with node:node user (default user for official nodejs images). By default it's `1000:1000` however it may be adjusted using `PUID` and `PGID` args.
2. It's possible to run contained with `-u UID:GID` params. Please note it is **not** the same as `PUID:PGID` args and it is **not** recommended at all (see description below)
3. Experimental build with node.js 20 (✓)
4. Images were optimized for Docker BuildX toolset (reorder docker layers, use cache mount points etc)

## Some of the Issues Addressed

### Rootless Container

Why: to not run process with under privileged user, to avoid creation file with root:root chown and to make possibility to run image(s) from predefined (non root) host user.
Problem: PostgresSQL images are ready for rootless run. Just use `-u` arg or `user: ` compose directive. However official Linkwarden image have multiple file permissions related problems.
How to fix:
Option 1: The custom images run under node:node (1000:1000) user by default. No any process with privileged user context anymore. Just run Docker/Docker Compose as usual without any extra parameters. All internal files are ready for this, all new files will be created with `1000:1000` owner.
Option 2. The custom images support `PUID` and `PGID` environment arguments to specify desired UID and GID. Please make sure that shared mount points has right permissions, all new files will be created with `PUID:PGID` owner.

An example of docker compose file:

```
name: linkwarden
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    env_file: .env
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    user: "${UID}:${GID}" # UID and GID must be specified in .env file, otherwise put the values here

  linkwarden:
    image: ghcr.io/linkwarden/linkwarden:latest
    env_file: .env
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/postgres
      - PUID=${UID:-1000} # UID and GID must be specified in .env file, otherwise put the values here
      - PGID=${UID:-1000} # UID and GID must be specified in .env file, otherwise put the values here
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data/data
    depends_on:
      - postgres
```

## Intro & motivation

**Linkwarden is a self-hosted, open-source collaborative bookmark manager to collect, read, annotate, and fully preserve what matters, all in one place.**

The objective is to organize useful webpages and articles you find across the web in one place, and since useful webpages can go away (see the inevitability of [Link Rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)), Linkwarden also saves a copy of each webpage as a Screenshot and PDF, ensuring accessibility even if the original content is no longer available.

In addition to preservation, Linkwarden provides a user-friendly reading and annotation experience that blends the simplicity of a “read-it-later” tool with the reliability of a web archive. Whether you’re highlighting key ideas, jotting down thoughts, or revisiting content long after it’s disappeared from the web, Linkwarden keeps your knowledge accessible and organized.

Linkwarden is also designed with collaboration in mind, enabling you to share links with the public and/or collaborate seamlessly with multiple users.

> Our official [Cloud](https://linkwarden.app/#pricing) offering provides the simplest way to begin using Linkwarden and it's the preferred choice for many due to its time-saving benefits. <br> Your subscription supports our hosting infrastructure and ongoing development. <br> Alternatively, if you prefer self-hosting Linkwarden, you can do so by following our [Installation documentation](https://docs.linkwarden.app/self-hosting/installation).
